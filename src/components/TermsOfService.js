      <p className="paragraph">
        Welcome to ArtsPassage. We’ve developed an online marketplace to help
        you find great artists and perform in events/teach lessons in your area.
        We tried to make this Services Agreement easy to read and understand.
        Please take time to read it carefully as it governs your use of our
        platform to book and list services.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        Importantly, except where prohibited by applicable law, this Agreement
        contains waivers of class actions and jury trials and an agreement to
        submit all claims and disputes to binding arbitration in Section 4
        below. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this
        Services Agreement, including those governing disputes in Section 4, you
        may not use our platform or services.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        When the Service Agreement mentions “ArtsPassage,” “we,” “us,” and
        “our,” it refers to ArtsPassage, Inc.

      <p className="paragraph">
        We provide a platform to help users connect with each other to book
        Artists and Services but do not endorse any specific Clients, Artists,
        or Vendors, or Vendor Services registered with or offered through the
        Platform. Any designations or badges provided through the Platform are
        based on the information we have available to us which may be provided
        by other users or third parties and which may be inaccurate or out of
        date and do not constitute endorsement. Each user is independent, and
        Artists are independent contractors, unaffiliated with ArtsPassage, that
        are solely responsible for the character, quality, utility and provision
        of any service they provide or do not provide to you.

      <h3 className="heading-2">Section 1: General Terms</h3>
      <h4 className="heading-3">1.1 Services</h4>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (a) Platform Services. ArtsPassage is a unique marketplace provider that
        offers several different services (“Services”) to its users. There are
        two types of ArtsPassage users: (1) Clients, e.g., our users who hire
        Artist Services (please see Section 3.2 for Client-specific terms); (2)
        Artists, e.g., our users who offer Performance or Lesson Services to
        Clients (please see Section 3.1 for Artist-specific terms). ArtsPassage
        connects them all through the ArtsPassage Platform (“Platform”) which is
        the online marketplace that allows our users to connect, communicate,
        and transact with each other directly through “Bookings.” We are
        continuously improving the Platform for all users and reserve the right
        to make changes at our discretion. Changes we make to the Platform,
        including discontinuing certain features, affect all users and we try to
        minimize disruption to users. However, these changes may affect users
        differently. We are not responsible if any specific changes we make to
        the Platform adversely affect how you use them.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        ArtsPassage is not an employer of Artists. ArtsPassage’s responsibility
        is limited to facilitating the availability of Services through the
        Platform. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED SOLELY
        TO FACILITATE CONNECTIONS AMONG ARTISTS AND CLIENTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF
        ARRANGING SERVICES FOR BOOKINGS THROUGH THE PLATFORM. ARTSPASSAGE SHALL
        HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY OR ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR THE
        INFORMATION OR CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS AND/OR THE CONDITION,
        LEGALITY, SAFETY, OR SUITABILITY OF ANY BOOKINGS OR ARTISTS.
        ACCORDINGLY, ANY BOOKINGS WILL BE MADE OR ACCEPTED AT A USER’S OWN RISK.
        AMONG OTHER THINGS, ARTISTS MUST SATISFY THEMSELVES WITH ANY CLIENT(S)
        AND THEIR CREDENTIALS, AND CLIENTS MUST SATISFY THEMSELVES WITH ARTISTS.
        USERS SHOULD NOT COMPLETE, AND SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CANCEL, ANY BOOKING IF
        THEY FEEL UNSAFE OR UNCOMFORTABLE WITH ANY CONDITIONS RELATING TO THE
        BOOKING IN ANY WAY. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR ABILITY TO USE
        THE SERVICES THROUGH THE PLATFORM DOES NOT ESTABLISH ARTSPASSAGE AS A
        PROVIDER OF ARTISTS OR ANY OTHER SERVICES.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (b) Artist Services. Artists may use our Platform to offer a specific
        talent, performance, or skills and related services to a Client for a
        specific time and purpose (an “Event”) using our Platform. Where an
        Artist provides one or more services related to a Clients need, such
        related services must be processed through our Platform. The details of
        each Artist, including its availability, booking price, additional fees,
        rules, and other terms are provided in a “Listing.” Please note,
        ArtsPassage does not employ, manage, or control the Artist listed, and
        does not make decisions surrounding whether to accept a Booking. In
        addition, Artists may provide goods or services for an event at an
        additional cost (“Artist Add-Ons”). Artists are solely responsible for
        their Listings, and Talent Services.
      </p>
      <h4 className="heading-3">1.2 Using Our Services</h4>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (a) Eligibility. You must be at least the legal age of majority in your
        jurisdiction of residence, and able to enter into legally binding
        contracts in order to access and use the Platform, create an account, or
        utilize any of the Services. By using the Platform and our Services, you
        represent and warrant that you meet all of the foregoing eligibility
        requirements. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not
        access or use the Platform. You represent that you will comply with all
        export control laws in your local jurisdiction. You agree to comply with
        any rules or requirements applicable to the Booking that you are made
        aware of, including as part of any confirmation e-mail (the “Rules”).
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        Without limiting the requirements and responsibilities set forth above,
        you acknowledge and agree that the Rules include your responsibility for
        taking all appropriate health, safety and hygiene measures to protect
        yourself and any Artists and Clients, and individuals attending any
        Event from the spread or potential spread of infectious diseases or
        conditions, or any other unhealthy, unsafe, or unsanitary conditions.
        You also acknowledge and agree that you have read and will comply with
        ArtsPassage COVID-19 Health & Safety Measures (the “Safety Measures”).
        ArtsPassage may update or supplement these Safety Measures from time to
        time in its sole discretion, so please check the Safety Measures
        frequently, including the version that is current at the time of your
        Booking and start time of the Event. For more information, please review
        guidance from applicable health authorities, such as the World Health
        Organization and the Centers for Disease Control. While the Safety
        Measures endeavor to curate best practices, there is no substitute for
        common sense, and ArtsPassage cannot and does not guarantee or take any
        responsibility or liability for (a) a User’s failure to provide safe,
        healthy, and sanitary services or accommodations for the Services, (b)
        unsafe, unhealthy, or unsanitary conditions, even if an Artist or Client
        has followed guidance from the Safety Measures, or (c) any spread or
        potential spread of infectious diseases or conditions, or any other
        unhealthy, unsafe, or unsanitary conditions resulting from use of the
        Services in any manner. For more information related to the release of
        liability for Clients, Artists, and ArtsPassage, see Section 5.1
        “Disclaimers”.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (b) Third Party Services and Content. Our Platform is made available to
        you in connection with the offering of third party services that
        ArtsPassage does not control. ArtsPassage does not endorse any such
        third party services and in no event shall ArtsPassage be liable or
        responsible for any third party services or third party services
        providers (like Artists).
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (c) Planning an Event. Our Platform allows users to connect to
        third-parties to plan Events. Users control the availability, quality,
        and terms of their Listings and Artist Services. It is your
        responsibility to evaluate each Client and Artist with whom you choose
        to contract, communicate, or otherwise interact. ArtsPassage is not
        responsible for the content posted by our users, nor are we responsible
        for the quality of Experiences or Artist Services offered. We do not
        make any representations or warranties as to the conduct of Users or
        their interactions with any current or future Users, or assume any
        responsibility for the confirmation of any user’s identity, however,
        notwithstanding the foregoing, and as permitted by applicable laws, we
        may, but have no obligation to, take efforts to verify the identity of
        users and/or screen them against public and private databases for the
        purposes of preventing fraudulent activity and providing a safe
        transacting community. While ArtsPassage reserves the right to conduct
        background checks or evaluate credentials of users, ArtsPassage does not
        do so in all cases.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (d) Bookings. When Users enter into Bookings with one another (e.g. when
        an Artist confirms a Booking request from a Client or enables a Booking
        without prior approval), they enter into a contract directly with one
        another. Any agreement you enter into with a Client or Artist is between
        you and the applicable party. ArtsPassage is not a party to any such
        contract. You understand and agree that ArtsPassage is not acting as an
        agent for any user, except for as specified in Section 3.2 (Using
        Concierge Services) and Section 1.4 (Appointment of ArtsPassage as a
        Limited Collection Agent). Users are prohibited from using the
        ArtsPassage platform to facilitate contracts outside of the Platform.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (e) Communication With ArtsPassage. You agree that ArtsPassage may
        contact you by telephone, text messages or SMS (including by an
        automatic telephone dialing system), through electronic messaging on the
        Platform, or via email at any of the communication methods provided by
        you or on your behalf in connection with your Account, including for
        marketing purposes. You understand that you are not required to provide
        consent to receive marketing communications as a condition of purchasing
        any goods or services, and you may opt out of those marketing
        communications at any time. You specifically consent to receive
        communications related to your Account through text messages, SMS, or
        other communications sent to your mobile device (“Mobile
        Notifications”). Standard mobile rates will apply for any Mobile
        Notifications you receive. You may stop receiving these Mobile
        Notifications at any point by responding to such messages with “STOP” or
        following the instructions included in a message. However, if you do so,
        you may miss critical messages related to your Account. We are not
        responsible for and disclaim all liability for all harm or losses caused
        by disabling Mobile Notifications. Please contact us if you experience
        issues when attempting to stop Mobile Notifications.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (f) Communications With Other Users. The Platform allows you to
        communicate with other users without disclosing sensitive personal
        contact information. You may use the Platform only as permitted in this
        Service Agreement. You may not use the Platform to send messages that
        are unwanted or unrelated to Booking a Listing through the Platform,
        harass or attempt to market other services to users, or to solicit
        and/or send spam. We are not responsible for, and disclaim all liability
        resulting from, any losses or harm to you resulting from sharing
        personal or sensitive information with other users, or communicating or
        engaging with users outside of the Platform. More information regarding
        appropriate communications conduct when using ArtsPassage is included in
        our Community Guidelines. ArtsPassage, at its sole option and without
        notice or any obligation to do so, may from time to time (i) remove
        communications among users which contain or share personal contact
        information, or (ii) suspend or terminate the accounts of users that
        share personal contact information.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (g) Compliance with the Law. You will comply with all Laws applicable to
        your use of the Artist Services, Platform Services (including use of the
        Platform), whether as a Client or Artist. While we may provide
        information to help you understand certain obligations of using various
        Services, we are not authorized to provide and do not provide any legal
        advice. If you are unsure how to comply with Laws, you should seek legal
        advice related to Listing or Booking an Artist. As used in this Service
        Agreement, “Laws” means all applicable federal, state, provincial,
        territorial, local, and other governmental laws, regulations,
        ordinances, codes, rules, court orders, and all recorded and unrecorded
        private contracts, restrictions, covenants and other agreements.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (h) Contractual Disputes Between Users. ArtsPassage may facilitate the
        resolution of disputes between users, but does not become a party to any
        contract by doing so. We are not responsible to you or any third party
        for providing, or for the condition or nature of, any Artists or Artist
        Services. Clients and Artists are independent third-parties and are not
        affiliated, controlled by, or employed by ArtsPassage. Artists set their
        own prices, use their resources, and may condition use of Services as
        they feel is appropriate for their business. Clients, and Artists are
        solely responsible for their interactions with each other, and any other
        parties with whom they interact. ArtsPassage reserves the right but has
        no obligation, to intercede in disputes. Users agree that ArtsPassage
        will not be responsible for any liability incurred as the result of such
        interactions. For more on Dispute Resolution, see Section 4 (Dispute
        Resolution).
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (i) Non-Circumvention. Artists and Clients acknowledge that ArtsPassage
        has devoted substantial time and resources in developing its catalog and
        Services of Listings, Artists, Artist Services, and Clients, and such
        information is inherently valuable information owned solely by
        ArtsPassage. Accordingly, Clients and Artists shall not circumvent or
        bypass ArtPassage’s ownership interest in such information, directly or
        indirectly, except in collaboration with or with the prior express
        written consent of ArtsPassage, by (1) entering into any transaction
        with any party introduced to it by ArtsPassage through its Platform (the
        “Introduced Party”) similar to, in competition with, or which otherwise
        could have the effect of preventing ArtsPassage from receiving the full
        benefit of the transactions contemplated by this Service Agreement, or
        (2) soliciting such an Introduced Party to enter into any such
        transaction. By way of illustration and not in limitation of the
        foregoing, users agree not to:
      </p>
      <div className="paragraph">
        <ol className="list">
          <li>
            Submit requests or solicit Clients, Artists, Artist Services
            including Artist Add-Ons, originally identified or introduced
            through the Platform to contract, hire, work with or compensate for
            services subsequently provided outside of the Platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            Accept requests or solicit Client, Artists, Artists Services
            including Artist Add-Ons originally identified or introduced through
            the Platform to contract, invoice or receive compensation for
            services provided outside of the Platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use any other information originally learned from the Platform,
            whether through the messaging function, booking process or
            otherwise, to conduct subsequent transactions related to
            ArtPassage’s Services outside of the Platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a Client or Artist breaches its obligations under this
            Non-Circumvention provision, the breaching party shall pay to
            ArtsPassage an amount equal to 20% of the subtotal of the relevant
            booking (the “Liquidated Damages”). The parties intend that the
            Liquidated Damages amount will constitute compensation and not a
            penalty. The parties also agree that the harm caused by such a
            breach would be impossible or very difficult to accurately estimate
            as of the date of this Service Agreement and that the Liquidated
            Damages are therefore a reasonable estimate of the anticipated or
            actual harm that might arise from such a breach. A Client or
            Artist's payment of the Liquidated Damages is his, her or its sole
            liability and entire obligation and ArtsPassage’s exclusive remedy
            for any such breach.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (j) App Updates and Upgrades. You consent to receive updates or upgrades
        to the application (“App”) automatically without providing further
        consent each time. The App (including any updates or upgrades) may: (i)
        cause your device to automatically communicate with our servers to
        deliver the functionality described in the App description or through
        new features as they are introduced, and to record usage metrics; (ii)
        affect preferences or data stored on your device; and (iii) collect
        personal information as set out in our Privacy Policy. We are not
        responsible if an update or upgrade affects how the App works if this is
        caused by your own equipment or device not supporting the update or
        upgrade. You can withdraw consent at any time under certain conditions
        by contacting us.
      </p>
      <h4 className="heading-3">1.3 Your Account</h4>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (a) Registration. Before using the Platform or Services, you must create
        an account with ArtsPassage (“Account”) and provide us with information
        about yourself or your company. You can also create an Account through
        your account with certain third party services, such as Facebook,
        Google, or Apple. You may disable this connection by contacting us or
        directly through the settings menu of the third party service. If you
        are registering on behalf of a legal entity, you represent and warrant
        that you have the authority to legally bind that entity and grant all
        rights, permissions, and licenses contained in this Service Agreement or
        any other applicable terms, in your jurisdiction of residence.
        Misrepresenting your affiliation or association with an entity may
        result in immediate termination of your Account, ineligibility to
        participate in any of our Services, monetary damages, and reporting to
        the appropriate legal authority.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (b) Account Security. You will be required to provide an email address
        and password to keep your Account secure (“Credentials”) and agree to
        keep your Credentials private and secure. You are responsible for any
        actions associated with your Account whether or not authorized. You are
        solely responsible for the actions or communications of your employees,
        representatives, hires, or agents (“Agents”). We are not responsible for
        and disclaim all liability for use of your Account by your Agents. You
        may not assign or transfer your Account to another party without our
        prior written consent.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (c) Account Updates. We may ask that you update your Account or provide
        additional or different information at any time. This includes requiring
        additional details about Artists or payment information. You are
        required to update all Account information necessary to maintain
        compliance with this Service Agreement, including but not limited to
        maintaining proper contact information and payment information.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (d) Account Termination By You. You may terminate your Account at any
        time by notifying us. You are responsible for all activity associated
        with your Account made before it is closed including: (i) payment of
        Fees, Taxes, Fines or other charges; (ii) providing use of Artist
        Services to Clients as previously Booked; or (iii) other liabilities
        caused by or resulting from use of the Platform or Service. We may
        retain Content and continue to display and use any public Content
        (including comments or reviews of Artists) after your Account is
        terminated. Termination of your Account does not terminate any
        contractual arrangements you have with third parties, including any
        obligations to government entities for tax purposes.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">

      <p className="paragraph">
        (a) Fees and Payments. You understand that ArtsPassage may initiate
        charges to you for the goods or services you receive. By using our
        Services, you authorize ArtsPassage to receive and/or enable your
        payment of applicable charges for the goods or services (including third
        party services like Artist Services and Vendor Services) obtained
        through your use of the Platform and Platform Services.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        Subject to applicable law, you acknowledge and accept that, as between
        you and ArtsPassage, ArtsPassage may revise charges for any services
        obtained through use of the Platform at any time in ArtsPassage’s sole
        discretion. ArtsPassage will make reasonable efforts to inform you of
        the charges incurred through your use of the Platform Services, but you
        shall be responsible for all charges incurred under your Account
        regardless of your awareness of such charges. The charges you incur may
        be owed directly to third party service providers (like Artist
        Services), and ArtsPassage will collect those charges from you, on the
        third party’s behalf as their limited collection agent, and payment of
        such charges by you will be considered the same as if made directly by
        you to the third party service provider. ArtsPassage reserves the right
        to otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any remedies available
        to ArtsPassage in circumstances in which you are deemed liable or owing
        for any unpaid fees, damages, fines or other sums for which you are
        responsible, as decided by ArtsPassage in its sole discretion and in
        accordance with this Service Agreement, the applicable policy set by
        ArtsPassage, and/or the terms of the Booking Agreement mentioned in the
        Listing.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (b) Fees Charged by ArtsPassage. ArtsPassage charges services fees to
        its users in exchange for use of the Platform Services or for providing
        Concierge Services. Artists are charged Artist Fees; Clients are charged
        Clients Fees, Fees (collectively “Service Fees”). Service Fees are
        described in more detail on our Fees Overview. All applicable Service
        Fees and Taxes will be displayed to the applicable user prior to
        completion of a Booking. ArtsPassage reserves the right to alter or
        amend its fees at any time and such changes will become effective after
        reasonable notice has been given.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (c) Artist Charges and Additional Fees. A Booking provides a limited use
        of an Artists Service as described in the Listing and Booking Agreement,
        if applicable, for which the Artist charges a fee (the “Booking Price”).
        Where Artist Services or Artist Add-Ons are provided to supplement the
        use of Artist Services, such services must be processed through our
        Platform. An Artist may sometimes also charge an Equipment Fee in
        association with the Artist Services. If the Artist offers Artist
        Add-Ons in a Booking, the Artist may also charge an Artist Add-On Fee.
        If you use an Artist Services beyond that specified in your agreement
        with another user you will be responsible for payment of additional Fees
        (“Additional Fees”) as described on the Fees Overview. Additional Fees
        are determined based on the factors described in the Listing. As a
        Client, you are solely responsible for any damage done to the Artist or
        the Artist Equipment by anyone attending or working at your Event.
        Artist must notify us within 72 hours of a request for payment of
        Additional Fees. Users agree that ArtsPassage may, in its sole
        discretion, determine whether an Artist is entitled to receive
        Additional Fees in accordance with this Service Agreement, the
        applicable policy set by ArtsPassage, and/or the terms of the Booking
        Agreement between the Client and Artist mentioned in the Listing.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (d) Most Favored Customers. Artists agree that any rate charged to
        Clients through the Platform will be equal to or better than those made
        available through their own or any third-party booking or other
        distribution channels. Any rules, restrictions, policies, and/or
        conditions (including rules associated with cancellation) applicable to
        any Service that Artist make available on the Platform shall be no more
        restrictive than those applicable to any comparable Service that such
        Artists make available through their own or any third-party booking or
        other distribution channels.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (e) Prepaid Fees. Certain Bookings may require you to provide a portion
        of prepaid Fees or a refundable amount (“Deposit”) in advance. All Fees
        and Deposits, as applicable, will be identified prior to completing your
        Booking. If held by ArtsPassage, at our option, Deposits may be credited
        to your Booking or returned when the Event is finished. While we may
        facilitate the collection of Fees and Deposits, subject to applicable
        law, once remitted to Artists, we are not responsible for the return of
        Fees or Deposits to Clients, where applicable.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (f) Taxes and Fines. You are solely responsible for payment of all
        taxes, levies, penalties, and other costs imposed by any taxing
        authority or government agency related to Listing or Booking Artists or
        Artists Services including any sales or occupancy tax, indirect taxes
        such as valued added tax (VAT) or goods and services tax (GST), usage or
        permitting fees, duties, and other taxes imposed by municipalities,
        states, provinces, territories, or governments through regulation,
        ordinance, law, or judicial or regulatory interpretation (collectively
        “Taxes”). Except as required by Law, ArtsPassage will not calculate,
        track or pay Taxes or submit Tax reporting on your behalf. You are
        responsible for all Taxes owed for Booking or Listing yourself/talent,
        or providing or using Artist Services including, without limitation,
        accurate calculation of Taxes due, timely remittance of Taxes to the
        appropriate taxing authority and maintenance of any required records and
        accounts. If any taxing authority demands that we pay such Taxes on your
        behalf, you are immediately liable to us for such Taxes and will
        reimburse or pay ArtsPassage for such Taxes upon demand. You are also
        responsible for any penalties arising from your failing to comply with
        this Service Agreement including those issued by regulatory or taxing
        authorities, law enforcement, fire code or safety agencies, or other
        third parties; or that may be issued by us for losses we or users incur
        that are based on your failing to comply with this Service Agreement or
        misuse of the Platform, Services, or Artist Services (collectively,
        “Fines”). You understand and agree that ArtsPassage does not provide you
        with any advice or guidance of any kind or nature regarding Taxes and
        that you have been advised to consult with your tax advisor for any
        required advice or guidance regarding Taxes.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (g) Payment. You will timely and fully pay any Fees, Deposits, Taxes,
        Fines, or other amounts you owe under this Service Agreement. If you owe
        amounts and we are unable to receive payment through the Platform for
        any reason, then we may require that you pay through other means (such
        as direct debit, wire transfer, or cashiers’ check). We may set-off any
        amounts owed to us through collection of funds that would otherwise be
        payable to you through the Platform. You are responsible for any costs
        or expenses associated with our recovering Fees, Taxes, or Fines owed,
        including our legal fees or expenses. In our discretion, any late
        payments of more than 7 days may incur a late charge of up to ten
        percent (10%) and accumulate interest of twenty-five percent (25%) per
        annum until delinquency is resolved. We may use any legal means
        available to us to collect delinquent payments, including collections
        agencies or court filings.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (h) Payment Processing. Acceptance and payment of funds between users or
        ArtsPassage on the Platform (“Payment Processing”) is provided by
        Stripe. Your use of Payment Processing is subject to the Stripe
        Connected Account Agreement that includes the Stripe Services Agreement
        (collectively, the “Stripe Agreement”). By agreeing to this Service
        Agreement or continuing to operate as a Client or Artist on ArtsPassage,
        you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may
        be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of using Payment
        Processing, you must provide accurate and complete information about you
        and your business and you authorize us to share this information to
        Stripe. All bank and credit card information is sent directly to and
        stored with Stripe using their security protocols. ArtsPassage does not
        store your payment information on its systems and shall not have any
        responsibility for the safety or security of that information. Your use
        of Payment Processing is conditioned upon your compliance with the
        Stripe Agreement, and if the Stripe Agreement is terminated by Stripe
        you may not be able to use the Platform, or have your Account suspended
        or terminated. We may change or add other payment processing services at
        any time upon notice to you, which may be subject to additional terms or
        conditions.

      <p className="paragraph">
        Appointment of ArtsPassage as a Limited Collection Agent. Each user
        (such as Clients, or Artists who facilitate certain transactions through
        our Platform) who collects payment for services provided via the
        Platform (“Collecting User”) hereby appoints ArtsPassage as the
        Collecting User’s payment collection agent solely for the limited
        purpose of accepting funds from other users purchasing such services
        (“Paying User”).
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        Each Paying User acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding the fact
        that ArtsPassage is not a party to the agreement between you and the
        Collecting User, ArtsPassage acts as the Collecting User’s payment
        collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you
        on behalf of the Collecting User. Once a Paying User makes payment of
        funds to ArtsPassage, the Paying User’s payment obligation to the
        Collecting User for the agreed-upon amount is extinguished, and
        ArtsPassage is responsible for remitting the funds to the Collecting
        User in the manner described in this Service Agreement, which
        constitutes ArtsPassage's agreement with the Collecting User. In the
        event that ArtsPassage does not remit any funds, the Collecting User
        will have recourse only against ArtsPassage and not the Paying User
        directly.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        Each Collecting User agrees that payment made by a Paying User through
        ArtsPassage shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to
        the Collecting User. The Collecting User will provide the purchased
        services to the Paying User in the agreed-upon manner as if the
        Collecting User has received the payment directly from the Paying User.
        Each Collecting User agrees that ArtsPassage may refund the Paying User
        in accordance with this Service Agreement (including all applicable
        terms referenced herein) and each Collecting User understands that
        ArtsPassage’s obligation to pay the Collecting User is subject to and
        conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from
        Paying User. ArtsPassage shall be obligated to make payments to
        Collecting User only for such amounts that have been actually received
        by ArtsPassage from Paying User in accordance with this Service
        Agreement. In accepting appointment as the limited payment collection
        agent of the Collecting User, ArtsPassage assumes no liability for any
        acts or omissions of the Collecting User.

        (a) Privacy. ArtsPassage is, at all times, considered the controller of
        personally identifiable information collected through the Platform.
        Personally identifiable information (“PII”) means any data collected or
        obtained by or on behalf of ArtsPassage in connection with this Service
        Agreement or through the Platform that identifies, may be used to
        identify, contact, or locate a person to whom such information pertains,
        or from which identification of an individual person can be derived. PII
        includes, but is not limited to: name, photographic likeness, physical
        address, email address, IP address, phone number, credit card number(s),
        bank account routing numbers, or other similar information. Our
        practices related to PII collected by or through the Platform are
        disclosed in our Privacy Policy. As between us and a Artist, disclosure
        of PII in connection with a Booking or an Event shall not be deemed a
        sale of PII, but an intentional disclosure at the direction of the
        Clients or end-user whose PII is subject to disclosure. Neither party
        shall be deemed the service provider, processor, custodian, or agent of
        the other party with respect to the PII shared pursuant to this Service
        Agreement. However, in the event applicable Laws prohibit such action,
        Artists shall not sell the PII received from us in connection with this
        Service Agreement without first providing the individual to whom the PII
        pertains the right to opt-out of such sales. Each party is solely
        responsible for its own compliance with any Laws related to privacy and
        data security to which that party is subject. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, ArtsPassage may anonymize, pseudonymize, or aggregate any
        information, including personal information or Content, and use this
        information in a non-identifiable form for any purpose including
        improvement of the Platform or Services, or creating or distributing
        public marketing collateral.

      <p className="paragraph">
        (b) Data Security. Only duly authorized ArtsPassage personnel or
        contractors are permitted to access a User’s non-public information
        (“Personal Data”), and only to fulfill the obligations of this Service
        Agreement. ArtsPassage shall immediately notify Users of any known or
        suspected security breach that may result in the unauthorized use,
        access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of Personal Data.
        ArtsPassage shall immediately notify Users of any legally binding

      <h4 className="heading-3">3.1 Terms Applicable To Artists</h4>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (a) Listings. When you make a Service available for Bookings (“List” a
        Service) as an Artist, you must provide all required details about the
        Service including a description, how it may be used, the cost of a
        Booking, availability, a list of any facilities, current pictures,
        rules, and other details about its potential uses and condition
        (collectively, “Description”). This includes details regarding the use
        of any equipment, Artist Add-Ons available at an additional charge,
        While it is important to communicate excitement and the benefits of your
        Artist Service, the Description must be accurate and give potential
        Clients a reasonably accurate understanding of how they may use your
        talent for their Event, including the disclosure of any restrictions.
        Any terms or conditions included in your Listing must not conflict with
        this Service Agreement or applicable policies unless expressly permitted
        by ArtsPassage in writing. For example, you may not (i) modify or expand
        a Client's financial responsibilities or limit a Client's ability to
        seek recourse or restitution under this Service Agreement, (ii) violate
        the Community Guidelines or Laws, or (iii) require Clients to pay you
        directly outside the Platform.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (b) Permission to List And Book Artists. You represent and warrant that
        you are permitted under applicable Laws to List and confirm a Booking of
        any Services provided, that Services comply with applicable Laws.
        Artists acknowledge and agree that they may not List or confirm a
        Booking that they do not own or for which they do not otherwise have
        express permission to List. Artists represent and warrant that they are
        authorized to enter into the Service Agreement and participate in all
        requirements for the Listing, Booking, and collection of Payments, or
        other terms pertaining to Artists. In addition, you represent and
        warrant that any Listing you post, any Booking of a Service, will not
        breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties,
        including but not limited to, Management companies, Talent Agencies,
        Managers, Recording companies, Label Companies, or other agreements, and
        will comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, restrictions
        (including having permits, licenses, and/or registrations), or other
        terms placed on the Artist Service.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (c) Bookings. Bookings are created when you accept a booking request,
        receive an acceptance to a custom offer you have submitted to a Client,
        or enable your Listing to be booked without prior approval (“Instant
        Booking”) by a Client. Bookings are a legally binding agreement between
        you and a Client which means you are required to provide the Artist
        Services as described in your Listing and according to the terms agreed
        to in your Booking. You also agree to pay the applicable Service Fees to
        ArtsPassage.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (d) Booking Price. You are solely responsible for setting the Booking
        Price (including applicable Taxes, Equipment Fees, and Artists Services
        Fees). You may not raise the Booking Price for a particular Client after
        the Client accepts the Booking but may alter prices based on the
        addition or deletion of Artist Add-Ons prior to the Event. Artspassage
        may determine, in its sole discretion, to refund the Client part or all
        of the Booking Price in accordance with its policies.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (e) Booking Agreements. In certain cases, we may elect to require a
        supplemental Booking Agreement with your Listing that includes all or
        part of the Description including a listing of any additional terms and
        conditions. Where required, the Booking Agreement will incorporate this
        Agreement and supplement and be a part of the binding agreement between
        you and a Client. Except where approved by ArtsPassage, Booking
        Agreements with supplemental clauses may not impose rules or limitations
        on use that are materially different from those listed in the
        Description, include any additional contractual obligations, or alter
        Clients’ or Artists’ liabilities.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (f) Recordings. During their Event, Clients may photograph, film, or
        otherwise record events (“Event Recordings”). Except as expressly
        prohibited by federal, state, provincial, territorial, local or other
        governmental Laws or as otherwise set forth in the Description or any
        Booking Agreement, you grant to any Client that Books you a fully-paid,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual license to use, copy, transmit,
        distribute, modify, publicly display, and sublicense Event Recordings
        that may include or identify you.
      </p>
      <h4 className="heading-3">3.2 Terms Applicable to Clients.</h4>

      <p className="paragraph">
        (a) Bookings. Bookings are created when an Artist accepts your booking
        request or enables their listing to be booked without prior approval via
        the Instant Booking feature. Bookings are a legally binding agreement
        between you and an Artist and are subject to any additional terms and
        conditions that the Artist has outlined in their listing description or
        via messaging, any supplemental Booking Agreements, and other terms set
        forth by the Artist, which will be provided to you prior to confirmation
        of a Booking. A Booking creates a contractual relationship between
        users. The scope of the use—including times, specific fees, and other
        additional terms or limitations—may also be included in or supplemented
        by a separate Booking Agreement that incorporates the terms and
        conditions of this Agreement and referenced policies.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (b) Booking Confirmation. The client must have a valid Account in order
        to complete Bookings. Bookings can be completed by following the Booking
        process for the applicable Artist Service. Clients are encouraged to
        review the Listings Description, applicable services descriptions, and
        confirm availability prior to Booking an Artist or Artist Services. Some
        Artists and services may require additional or supplemental verification
        in order to confirm a Booking. For example, Clients may be required to
        verify their age in order to Book Artists for an Event. Applicable Fees
        and other charges (e.g. a Deposit, if applicable) will be shown before
        you complete your Booking. You are responsible for all Fees, charges,
        and Taxes associated with the Booking. All Bookings are subject to our
        Cancellation and Refund Policy.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (c) Conduct and Fees. You agree to comply with the Community Guidelines
        and any Booking Agreements throughout the Booking and use the Artist
        Service only as permitted or agreed upon and consistent with the
        Description, and assure that any attendees do the same. During your
        Booking, you are responsible for (i) the behavior and acts of any
        attendees, service providers, or others that are in contact with the
        Artist, (ii) ensuring that the use of the Artist does not exceed any
        limitations identified in the Booking, (iii) coordinating the timely
        setup or breakdown of your Event. All Fees owed by Clients are subject
        to the Fees Overview and Cancellation and Refund Policy.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (d) Cancellation and Refunds. All Bookings are subject to a grace
        period, which provides a refund for Bookings cancelled within
        twenty-four (24) hours from receipt of a Booking confirmation.
        Cancellations and any refunds that may be available to you are subject
        to our Fees Overview and Cancellation and Refund Policy. To cancel a
        Booking, you must submit a request to cancel using the “Cancel Booking”
        function on the Platform; cancellation requests may not be submitted
        through any other method, including messages, phone calls, chats or
        emails. In the event of an authorized cancellation of a confirmed
        Booking, or if ArtsPassage cancels a confirmed Booking at any time prior
        to an Event, ArtsPassage may, in its sole discretion, issue (i) a
        partial or full refund; or (ii) a dollar-for-dollar credit (“ArtsPassage
        Credit”) that may be applied towards a future Booking.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (e) Holdovers and Additional Fees. You agree to let the artist go no
        later than the end-time of your agreement or at such other time as
        mutually agreed upon between you and the Artist. You agree to pay to
        Artist an overtime charge (“Overtime Charge”) as well as all applicable
        Client Fees, Taxes, and other expenses incurred by the Artist. We may
        calculate the Overtime Charges based on your exceeding the time (for
        example, a calculated hourly rate billed in 30-minute increments).
        ArtsPassage may charge an additional Service Fee for any Overtime
        Charges, Damages, or any other charges assessed by Artists using the
        Platform. You may read more about all fees and charged in our Fees
        Overview. If ArtsPassage, in its sole discretion, determines that an
        Artist is entitled to additional fees, charges, or damages in accordance
        with this Service Agreement, the applicable policy set by ArtsPassage,
        and/or the terms of the Booking Agreement between the Client and Artist
        mentioned in the Listing, ArtsPassage will be entitled to collect any
        such sums from you required to satisfy the outstanding obligation.
        ArtsPassage reserves the right to otherwise collect payment from you and
        pursue any remedies available to ArtsPassage in this regard in
        situations in which you are responsible for fees, charges, or damages,
        including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made
        by Artists.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (f) Using Artist Services. You are responsible for evaluating the
        description, costs, restrictions, and applicable terms for any Artist
        Services provided by the Artist in connection with a Booking. You are
        responsible for identifying and complying with all laws, rules,
        regulations, and restrictions applicable to your use of any Artist
        Services. Subject to applicable law, we are not responsible for and
        disclaim all responsibility for and liability resulting from Artist’s
        actions or failure to act, for the nature or quality of any Artist
        Services, and for any loss or injury, you or others sustain arising out
        of or related to Artist Services.
      </p>
      <h4 className="heading-3">3.3 Insurance</h4>
      <p className="paragraph">
        You shall acquire and maintain all insurance as required by Law and
        suitable for you or your business. You are solely responsible for
        understanding and evaluating what insurance is appropriate to cover
        damage, loss, injury, legal liability, and other harm specific to you,
        your business, your Attendees, third parties, the Artist Service
        (including personal property within), and deciding what type of
        coverage, limits and providers are appropriate for you.

        Section 4: Disputes, and Binding Arbitration
      </h3>
      <h4 className="heading-3">4.1 Disputes Between Users</h4>

      <p className="paragraph">
        ArtsPassage encourages all users to resolve disputes informally between
        themselves. Users should notify ArtsPassage of a potential User Dispute
        within 72 hours after an Event and document any damage, disputes,
        statements, or other material facts that may impact a User Dispute and
        impact the enforcement of any applicable term, policy, or provision.
        Disputes between users may be escalated through the following process:
      </p>
      <div className="paragraph">
        <ul className="list">
          <li>
            i) Level One: Informal Dispute Resolution Between Users. You agree
            to first attempt to resolve any disputes, disagreements, or claims
            that you have with other users (each, a “User Dispute”) in good
            faith through messaging via the Platform. If users are unable to
            mutually resolve the User Dispute, then either user may submit the
            User Dispute to ArtsPassage's Disputes Team.
          </li>
          <li>
            ii) Level Two: Review by ArtsPassage's Disputes Team. If informal
            dispute resolution is not successful, a user may submit a User
            Dispute for review by submitting a written summary of the User
            Dispute, including any requested documentation, to ArtsPassage’s
            Disputes Team at disputes@artspassage.com. The Disputes Team will
            attempt to resolve the User Dispute through communication with the
            users. If users agree to a resolution, or if ArtsPassage determines
            in its sole discretion that a user is responsible for fees, damages,
            costs, refunds, or other amounts, you agree that ArtsPassage may
            collect such amounts from you pursuant to this Service Agreement,
            any Booking Agreement, or any applicable policy. Users agree, upon
            ArtsPassage’s reasonable request, to participate in a mediation or
            similar dispute resolution process with the other user which process
            will be conducted by ArtsPassage or a third party selected by
            ArtsPassage. Users will not be charged for any mediation or
            resolution process arranged by ArtsPassage.

      </div>
      <h4 className="heading-3">4.2 Binding Arbitration</h4>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (a) Process for Arbitration. You and ArtsPassage agree that any dispute,
        claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Service
        Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or
        validity thereof, or to the use of the ArtsPassage Platform or Services
        (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled through binding arbitration
        and not in a court of law, as follows:
      </p>
      <div className="paragraph">
        <ol className="list">
          <li>
            if the amount of the Dispute is less than $25,000 U.S. dollars
            (“$USD), resolution shall be administered online by FairClaims
            (www.fairclaims.com) or another online arbitration provider of our
            choosing in accordance with their applicable arbitration rules and
            procedures effective at the time a claim is made. You consent to
            receive electronic service of process at the email associated with
            your Account. Where you are delinquent in responding to such
            process, you will be responsible for any legal, court, or other fees
            associated with the delinquency. The party filing the User Dispute
            will be responsible for payment of any costs associated with that
            filing, including costs borne by ArtsPassage. As a part of the User
            Dispute, you may also seek to recover these costs if you prevail.
          </li>
          <li>
            if the amount of the dispute, claim or controversy is reasonably
            $USD25,000 or more, resolution shall be before a single arbitrator
            and administered by JAMS. This includes but is not limited to any
            statutory or common law claims relating to breach, enforcement, or
            interpretation of this Service Agreement and any Booking Agreement.
            Any such arbitration will take place in the county where the Booked
            or Artist is located unless you and ArtsPassage mutually agree
            otherwise. The arbitrator will apply the substantive Laws of
            California. All claims from $USD25,000 to $USD250,000 shall be
            subject to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p className="paragraph">
        The Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) will govern all such
        arbitrations under this Service Agreement. To initiate such an
        arbitration, a party will provide a written demand that states both the
        basis of the claim and the desired relief. Each party irrevocably and
        unconditionally consents to service of process through personal service
        at their corporate headquarters, registered address, or primary address
        (for individuals or sole proprietors). Nothing in this Service Agreement
        affects the right of any party to serve process in any other manner
        permitted by Law.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        Once arbitration is initiated as provided in Subsections (1) or (2)
        above, the parties will share the costs of the arbitration, facilities,
        and arbitration reporters (as necessary) equally except as otherwise
        determined by the arbitrator. Each party will be responsible for its own
        legal fees and legal costs. The arbitrator may award the prevailing
        party recovery of any of the costs of arbitration or legal fees as they
        see appropriate.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (b) Remedies. The arbitrator may provide for any monetary or other
        remedies that are available under applicable Law but may not modify the
        terms of this Service Agreement or any Booking Agreement. The arbitrator
        will provide a reasoned decision addressing the specifics of the
        dispute. The decision is binding and not subject to appeal. The parties
        will act promptly to respect the decision of the arbitrator, including
        payment of any amounts owed or taking of any action required. Any
        judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
        court having jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        (c) Certain Claims Excluded. Notwithstanding Section 4.2 the parties
        agree that any claims based on ownership or misuse of the other party’s
        intellectual property—including patents, copyrights, or trademarks—may
        be brought before the state or Federal courts located in San Francisco,
        California. Either party may also seek provisional remedies for
        injunctive relief under such claims from a court of competent
        jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <h4 className="heading-3">4.3 Class Action and Jury Waiver</h4>
      <p className="paragraph">
        Each party agrees that any action or claim arising from or related to
        this Service Agreement or any Booking Agreement may only be brought on
        an individual basis and not part of a class action or consolidated
        arbitration, or join claims with other users or third parties. Further,
        each party expressly waives its right to a jury in arbitration and
        court, where permitted.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        You may opt-out of this class action and jury waiver described herein by
        emailing us within 30 days of your first use of the Platform or
        Services. You must include your name, phone number, physical address,
        and email address in your opt-out notice. This is your only mechanism
        for opting out of this Section and failure to do so as described
        constitutes your consent to this waiver. If you choose to opt-out of
        this Section please note that all other provisions in this Service
        Agreement will remain intact and in full force and effect. This waiver
        section is not applicable where prohibited by law.
      </p>
      <h4 className="heading-3">4.4 Conflict of Rules</h4>
      <p className="paragraph">
        If any provision of this Section 4 is found to be invalid or
        unenforceable, the reviewing court or arbitrator, as applicable, will
        interpret or revise the provisions only as minimally necessary to comply
        with Law. All the other provisions will remain enforceable and intact as
        written.
      </p>
      <h4 className="heading-3">4.5 Confidentiality of Proceedings</h4>
      <p className="paragraph">
        Any proceedings pursuant to this Section 4 and their results will be
        maintained as confidential by all parties. Except as may be required by
        Law, the parties and those persons participating in the proceedings on
        their behalf will not disclose and will maintain the confidentiality of
        all materials, testimony, and evidence provided during the proceeding as
        well as the results of such proceeding. The parties agree to enter into
        a separate confidentiality agreement or order, as appropriate, to
        maintain the confidentiality of the proceedings.
